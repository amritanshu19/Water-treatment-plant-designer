# Water-treatment-plant-designer
This project provides a spread sheet calculator to design a water treatment unit for a specific location. The design will consider various factors such as the source of the water, the contaminants present, and the desired quality of the treated water.


Project Set-up
To facilitate the design process and collaboration among team members, we will be using Google Spreadsheets to organize and track our progress.

The spreadsheet can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O9qXv_7f9Ls_-GXPhzR61xugSiGjAYSLHJPRrrGvh3U/edit?usp=sharing).

Workflow
Identify the source and characteristics of the water: The first step in the design process is to gather information about the source of the water and its characteristics. This includes the pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and any specific contaminants present.

Determine the desired quality of the treated water: Based on the intended use of the treated water, we will determine the desired quality in terms of pH, TDS, and any specific contaminants that need to be removed.

Select treatment methods: Based on the characteristics of the water and the desired quality, we will select appropriate treatment methods. This may include processes such as filtration, aeration, and chemical treatment.

Design the treatment unit: Using the selected treatment methods, we will design the treatment unit including the necessary equipment and layout.

Evaluate and optimize the design: We will evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment unit through testing and make any necessary adjustments to optimize the design.
